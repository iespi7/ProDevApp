  <string name="balancing_left_right">I have always enjoyed math and science. Both subjects were my favorites in school. However, back in fifth grade, I was fortunate enough that my elementary school had a music program. I joined the orchestra and learned to play the cello. Needless to say, I fell in love with the instrument
  and decided to play through high school. I strongly feel that the balance between arts and sciences had a positive effect in my development.</string>
